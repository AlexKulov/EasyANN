# EasyANN

EasyANN is a graphical interface for the simplest work of the FANN library (Fast Artificial Neural Network Library, in more detail http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/).

EasyANN has a build system and standard graphical interface by Qt Creator, which allows you to easily run EasyANN both under Windows and Linux.
Note that EasyANN is not a complite-ready software, but is made for educational and/or research purposes to familiarize with neural networks.

Although on the official FANN website in the Graphical Interfaces section are already presented similar and more functional software products, we hope EasyANN will not be superfluous and will be useful for (post-graduate)students, researchers and junior programmers.

PS: thanks to [Alexander](https://github.com/dahelmm) for the design of qt widgets
